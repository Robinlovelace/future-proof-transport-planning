## Pool Cottage (2025)

::: notes
-   Hard to know how far to go back
-   Where I was born seems a good place to start, in Norton Canon
-   It wasn't this house, but was in the same location, in a photo taken in 1932. I have no idea how my dad got this photo, but it was a great find!
-   My mum and dad moved to Herefordshire in 1979
-   I was born in 1985, six years after they moved but the house still wasn't 100% finished, I may have inherited some of my dad's time optimism
-   Huge thanks to them for physically building a strong foundation for me

::: notes
-   Norton Canon is a village with around 200 people
-   It had a school, shop, pub church, post office and garage within walking distance when I was growing up but now only has two of those
-   It's remote, roughly equidistant from Hereford, Leominster and Hay on Wye
-   Although Hay on Wye is physically closer, it always felt further away because we rarely went that way, but you could feel the Welsh influence in the Black Mountains
-   I went to school in Weobley, which is a village with a primary school and secondary school, and a few shops, but not much else
-   I went to Hereford Sixth Form College in what felt like a big city at the time, but is less than a 10th the size of Leeds with around 50,000 people
-   I worked in the leisure centre in Leominster and played lots of sport

## Reproducibility and generalisability

Illustration of the ClockBoard zoning system used to visualize a geographically dependendent phenomena: air quality, measured in mass of PM10 particles, measured in micrograms per cubic meter, from the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI).
The facets show the data in spatial grid available from the LAEI, facet Am and aggregated to London boroughs B, to ClockBoard zones covering all the input data shown in C, and ClockBoard zones clipped by the administrative boundary of Greater London in D.

## Drivers of demand for transport planning

transport planning software was originally designed in the late 1950s and onwards to plan for

> increased use of cars \[for personal travel\], and trucks for deliveries and goods movement @boyce2015

Thankfully that is no longer a priority:

> Policy drivers have changed dramatically since then: climate change mitigation, air quality improvement and public health are prioritised in the emergent â€˜sustainable mobility paradigmâ€™ @lovelace2021

How could/should/will demand shift in the future?

## Stages of open and reproducible science

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
1.  Open access to the publications

2.  Open access to sample (synthetic if sensitive) data

3.  Open access to the code

4.  Fully reproducible paper published with documentation

5.  Project deployed in tool for non-specialist use

## Conclusions

-   Reproducible research is a key part of future-proofing transport planning, for your work, and for the discipline as a whole

-   Open source software and open access tools are key to this, especially if you want to have humans in the loop

-   AI is not a panacea, and has its own environmental costs

-   In this context, there are some key desirable features of future-proof transport models and associated software and tools:

    -   Open source
    -   Open access
    -   Reproducible
    -   Human-in-the-loop
    -   Easily adaptable to new data sources, methods, and demands

-   Would you want the AIs to be trained on your work?
    -   Initial thought: no way, that's my data!
    -   Second thought: if the AIs are going to take over, they might as well be well-informed, by good information and good intentions!
-   Would you want to be able to understand how the AIs work?
